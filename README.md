# Python-Network-Simulator

PyNetSim is a simple Python-based network simulator that allows users to create virtual network devices, establish connections between them, and visualize the network topology.

## Features

- Create virtual network devices (e.g., PCs, routers).
- Establish connections between devices.
- View the network topology.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pynetsim.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd pynetsim

## Example

```python
# Create devices
pc1 = Device("PC1", "192.168.1.1")
pc2 = Device("PC2", "192.168.1.2")
router = Device("Router", "192.168.1.254")

# Connect devices
pc1.connect(router)
pc2.connect(router)

# Display connections
print(f"{pc1.name} is connected to:")
for device in pc1.connections:
 print(f"- {device.name} ({device.ip})")
